# Space Cleanser Pro

A transparent Windows disk space manager that helps you understand and reclaim storage on your C: drive. Unlike Windows' cryptic Storage Settings, Space Cleanser shows you exactly what's eating your disk space with plain English explanations, safety ratings, and smart recommendations.

Whether you're a developer drowning in Gradle caches (31 GB, anyone?) or just wondering where your 237 GB went, Space Cleanser scans dev tool caches, browser data, Windows temp files, old downloads, and system logs - then helps you safely delete what you don't need. Every item includes a clear description of what it is, what happens if you delete it, and color-coded safety badges so you never have to guess.

**Built for anyone who's ever stared at "Other: 72.4 GB" and thought "but what IS that?"**
